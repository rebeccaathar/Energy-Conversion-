   abstract = {In the 1970s almost all models published in Ecological Modelling were either biogeochemical dynamic models or population dynamic models. The development in ecological modeling has been toward development of a wider spectrum of models, as modeling statistics shows. The new model types that have emerged are able to offer solutions for the modeling problems formulated by the modelers already in the 1970s. Today, it is possible to classify 11 types of models. An overview of these 11 model types, their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and areas of application, is presented.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a numerical analysis of end pole sizing and its effects on linear permanent magnet actuators using quasi-Halbach arrays. End effects are also considered in this analysis. Results show that end pole axial length may affect actuator performance causing magnetic saturation in back-irons, uneven magnetic flux distribution, additional force ripple, increase in reluctance force and lower force density. Therefore, these aspects must be taken into account while designing the machine.},
